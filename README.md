# JavaLoop2

We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:

(a+2^0*b), (a+2^0*b+2^1*b), (a+2^0*b+2^1*b+…….+2^n-1*b)

Task You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.
